This is a complete object-oriented **ABAP training project**, designed to demonstrate core concepts in ABAP such as:

- Inheritance
- Interfaces
- Factory pattern
- Internal tables
- Unit testing
- Code organization using classes

> üß† Built and tested using **Eclipse + ADT** on **SAP BTP Trial** ‚Äî without SAP GUI.
